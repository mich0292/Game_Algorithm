*Note: This game uses MonoGame framework.*

The game, Space Battle is a shoot ‚Äòem up game with a top-down perspective.\
There are a few objects in this game: asteroids, turrets, enemies, boss, missile, and player‚Äôs avatar.\
Since the assignment is for the Game Algorithm subject, the focus is on algorithms such as:
* kinematic seek
* dynamic wander 
* pattern movement (CatmullRomSpline) 
* line of sight (Bresenham's line), pathfinding (A* algorithm) 
* decision-making (finite state machine)

**Win Condition**

The player needs to progress through the stage without getting destroyed by the barrage of bullets from the enemies and defeat the boss at the end of the stage.

**Lose Condition**

The player loses all of their health bars.
